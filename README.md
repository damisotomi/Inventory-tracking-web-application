3. You can asssign quantities of these products to different warehouses and also delete these quantities. 
4. You can add, edit and delete warehouses (can only delete empty warehoues) and can also view all products in each warehouse along with their quantities.
5. You can see all transactions made into the warehouses. Sorted from newest to oldest.
6. You can add edit and delete product groups and assign products to different group.
